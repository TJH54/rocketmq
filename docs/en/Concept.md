# Basic Concept

## 1 Message Model

The RocketMQ message model is mainly composed of a Producer, a Broker and a Consumer.The Producer is responsible for producing messages, the Consumer is responsible for consuming messages, and the Broker is responsible for storing messages.     
A Broker corresponds to one server during actual deployment, and each Broker can store messages from multiple topics, and messages from each Topic can be stored in a different Broker by sharding strategy.     
A Message Queue is used to store the physical addresses of messages, and the Message addresses in each Topic are stored in multiple Message queues.The Consumer Group consists of multiple Consumer instances.    
##  2 Producer
 A producer is responsible for producing messages, typically by business systems.It sends messages generated by the business application systems to brokers. RocketMQ provides multiple paradigms of sending: synchronous, asynchronous,sequential and one-way.Both synchronous and asynchronous methods require the Broker to return confirmation information, while one-way sending is not required.
## 3 Consumer
 A Consumer responsible for consuming messages, typically the background system responsible for asynchronous consumption.A Consumer pulls messages from brokers and feeds them into application. In perspective of user application, two types of consumers are provided:Pull Consumer and Push Consumer.
## 4 Topic
  Topic refers to a collection of messages, each of which contains several messages, each of which can belong to only one topic, and is the basic unit of RocketMQ for message subscription.
## 5 Broker Server
The message broker role, which stores and forwards messages.In the RocketMQ system, a Broker Server is responsible for receiving messages sent from producers, store them and prepare to handle pull requests from consumers.It also stores message related meta data, including consumer groups, consuming progress offsets , topic and queue info.
## 6 Name Server
 Name server serves as the routing information provider. A producer or consumer can find a list of Broker IP addresses corresponding each topic through name server.Multiple Name server instances are clustered, but are independent of each other and do not exchange information.
## 7 Pull Consumer
 A type of Consumer.Applications are usually pulls messages from brokers by actively calling the Consumer's pull message method,and the initiative is controlled by the application. Once batches of messages are pulled, user application initiates consuming process.                    
## 8 Push Consumer
 A type of Consumer.Under this mode, after the Broker receives the data, it will actively push it to the consumer, which is generally of high real-time performance.                       
## 9 Producer Group
  A collection of the same type of Producer, which sends the same type of messages with consistent logic.If a transaction message is sent and the original producer crashes after sending, the Broker server will contacts other Producer in the same Producer group to commit or roll back consumption.
## 10 Consumer Group
  A collection of the same type of Consumer, which sends the same type of messages with consistent logic.Consumer Group achieve goals of load-balance and fault-tolerance, in terms of message consuming, is super easy.
Warning: consumer instances of a consumer group must have exactly the same topic subscription(s).   

RocketMQ supports two type of message mode:Clustering and Broadcasting.
## 11 Clustering
Under the Clustering mode, each Consumer instance of the same Consumer Group allocates messages equally.
## 12 Broadcasting
Under the Broadcasting mode, each Consumer instance of the same Consumer Group receives a full number of messages.
## 13 Normal Ordered Message
Under the Normal Ordered Message mode, the messages received by consumers through the same consumption queue are sequential, while the messages received by different message queues may be non-sequential.
## 14 Strictly Ordered Message
Under the Strictly Ordered Message mode, all messages received by the consumer are sequential.
## 15 Message
The physical carrier of information transmitted by a messaging system, the smallest unit of production and consumption data, each message must belong to a topic.
Each Message in RocketMQ has a unique Message ID and can carry a Key with a business identity.The system provides the function to query messages by Message ID and Key.
## 16 Tag
 Flags set for messages to distinguish different types of messages under the same topic.Messages from the same business unit can set different tag under the same topic in terms of different business purposes.The tag can effectively maintain the clarity and consistency of the code and optimize the query system provided by RocketMQ.Consumers can realize different consumption logic for different subtopics according to Tag, so as to achieve better expansibility.
